# Efficient_PermutationTesting
This repository contains the code of an algorithm developed at UW-Madison by C. Hinrichs*, V. K. Ithapu*, Q. Sun, V. Singh and S. C. Johnson, that performs Permutation Testing efficiently. The research behind this algorithm can all be found here: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vamsi/pt_fast.html

The paper that presents this novel algorithm is:

C. Hinrichs, V. K. Ithapu, Q. Sun, V. Singh, S. C. Johnson, Speeding up Permutation Testing in Neuroimaging, Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2013.

Where the first authors are Hinrichs and Itapu.

The package also makes use of the matrix completion code (GRASTA) developed by Jun He et al., which can be obtained here:

## CS 766: Computer Vision - Final Project

For my Computer Vision final project I will be cleaning up the code presented by Ithapu, et al. (2013), and re-implementing the computational intensive parts of the algorithm in C++.
