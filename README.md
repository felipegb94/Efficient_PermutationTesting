# Efficient_PermutationTesting
This repository contains the code of an algorithm developed at UW-Madison by C. Hinrichs*, V. K. Ithapu*, Q. Sun, V. Singh and S. C. Johnson, that performs Permutation Testing efficiently. The research behind this algorithm can all be found here: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vamsi/pt_fast.html

The paper that presents this novel algorithm is:

C. Hinrichs, V. K. Ithapu, Q. Sun, V. Singh, S. C. Johnson, Speeding up Permutation Testing in Neuroimaging, Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2013.

Where the first authors are Hinrichs and Itapu.
